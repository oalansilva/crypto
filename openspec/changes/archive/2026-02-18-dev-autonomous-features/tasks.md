## 1. Derived Feature Schema & Prompt

- [ ] 1.1 Extend Dev output schema to include `derived_features`
- [ ] 1.2 Update Dev prompt to allow/expect derived feature declarations

## 2. Derived Feature Generation

- [ ] 2.1 Implement derived feature registry (prev/lag, slope, rolling mean)
- [ ] 2.2 Generate derived columns after base indicators are computed
- [ ] 2.3 Validate and reject unsupported transforms with diagnostics

## 3. Tests & Verification

- [ ] 3.1 Add tests for derived feature parsing/validation
- [ ] 3.2 Add tests for derived feature computation and integration with logic preflight

> Note: Use project skills when applicable (architecture, tests, debugging, frontend).
