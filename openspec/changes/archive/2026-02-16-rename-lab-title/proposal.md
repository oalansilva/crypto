## Why

The /lab page title currently says “Strategy Lab,” which no longer matches the intended product naming. Aligning the title with the new “Agent Trader” branding improves clarity and consistency for users.

## What Changes

- Update the /lab page title from “Strategy Lab” to “Agent Trader”.
- Ensure the change is reflected in the main Lab header (and any related UI label tied to the page title).

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
- (none)

### Modified Capabilities
- `ui`: Update the Lab page title copy to “Agent Trader”.

## Impact

- Frontend UI (Lab page header/title).
- No backend or API changes.
