## Why

The Playground screen has a primary action labeled “New Backtest”. We want to rename it to “New Backtest2” to reflect updated product terminology and keep the UI consistent with current messaging.

## What Changes

- Rename the visible UI label/text from **“New Backtest”** to **“New Backtest2”** on the Playground screen.
- Ensure the change affects only display copy (no functional behavior change).

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
- `playground-ui`: UI copy and presentation for the Playground screen actions.

### Modified Capabilities
- (none)

## Impact

- Frontend UI text on the Playground page.
- Possibly localization/i18n resources if the label is sourced from translation files.
