# monitor Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change monitor-asset-type-filter. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Monitor MUST provide an Asset Type filter
The Monitor page (`/monitor`) MUST NOT provide an Asset Type filter while the MVP is crypto-only.

#### Scenario: Open monitor
- **WHEN** the user opens `/monitor`
- **THEN** the Monitor MUST display only crypto opportunities whose symbol contains `/`
- **AND** the Monitor MUST NOT expose a stocks option

### Requirement: Monitor hides strategy secrets from non-admin users
The Monitor API and UI MUST hide strategy implementation details from non-admin users while preserving the current trading decision workflow.

#### Scenario: Non-admin views monitor opportunity
- **WHEN** a non-admin user opens the Monitor
- **THEN** each opportunity MUST avoid showing the original strategy/template name
- **AND** each opportunity MUST avoid showing parameter values and indicator values
- **AND** the UI MUST show a protected strategy label instead of empty or broken content

#### Scenario: Admin views monitor opportunity
- **WHEN** an admin user opens the Monitor
- **THEN** each opportunity MUST show the original strategy/template name, parameters, indicator values, and analyzer context as before

#### Scenario: Non-admin exports opportunity summary
- **WHEN** a non-admin user exports or copies an opportunity summary
- **THEN** the exported payload MUST NOT include original strategy/template names, parameter values, indicator values, or analyzer details

### Requirement: Common-user Monitor follows Favorites star tiers
The Monitor page MUST show only strategies marked with 1, 2, or 3 stars by default, regardless of whether the opportunity resolves to HOLD, WAIT, or EXIT.

#### Scenario: Common user opens Monitor
- **WHEN** a non-admin user opens `/monitor`
- **THEN** the Monitor request MUST ask the backend for `tier=1,2,3`
- **AND** visible opportunities MUST exclude unstarred strategies (`tier=null`)
- **AND** opportunities with `tier=1`, `tier=2`, or `tier=3` MUST remain visible in their resolved HOLD, WAIT, or EXIT section
- **AND** the UI MUST NOT require the strategy to be in portfolio or in local Monitor favorites to appear

#### Scenario: Backend returns unstarred opportunity defensively
- **WHEN** the backend response contains an unstarred opportunity
- **THEN** the Monitor UI MUST not render that opportunity by default

#### Scenario: Admin opens Monitor
- **WHEN** an admin user opens `/monitor`
- **THEN** the existing operator filters and Monitor favorite preference controls MAY remain available

### Requirement: Monitor chart current marker matches active position state
The Monitor chart modal MUST represent an active `HOLD` opportunity as an open long position, not as an executed exit/sell marker.

#### Scenario: HOLD opportunity opens chart
- **WHEN** a Monitor opportunity is classified as active `HOLD`
- **AND** the chart has no historical signal markers to render
- **THEN** the chart current marker MUST use a long/entry-style visual
- **AND** the chart MUST NOT label the current marker as `EXIT`
- **AND** the distance panel MAY still label the next decision as `exit`

#### Scenario: WAIT or EXIT opportunity opens chart
- **WHEN** a Monitor opportunity is not an active `HOLD`
- **THEN** the chart marker and distance context MUST continue to follow the existing WAIT/EXIT resolution rules

#### Scenario: Current EXIT signal exists after the active entry
- **WHEN** the generated signal history has an `exit` event after the latest `entry`
- **THEN** the Monitor payload MUST classify the opportunity as not holding
- **AND** the Monitor list MUST place the opportunity in `EXIT`, not `HOLD`
- **AND** the chart modal MUST resolve the same opportunity as `EXIT` when the latest visible signal is the current exit execution candle
